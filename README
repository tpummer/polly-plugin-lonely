How to build

Well you will need polly to run this plugin, get it from here: https://github.com/skuzzle/polly and follow the instructions in the wiki

If you want to build this plugin extract the sources to: polly/projects/at.nullpointer.polly.plugin.lonely

In Eclipse you have to add some dependencies:
 * de.skuzzle.polly.sdk
 * de.skuzzle.polly.tools
 
 Then you can simple runt he ant build, to produce
  * polly/target/at.nullpoitner.polly.plugin.lonely/at.nullpointer.polly.plugin.lonely.jar
  * polly/target/at.nullpoitner.polly.plugin.lonely/at.nullpointer.polly.plugin.lonely.properties
 
 Because this is not an official plugin you have to move these two files manually into the plugin folder of your core polly installation
